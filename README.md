Ghost Forest

Ghost Forest is an exciting game where you play as a brave girl who is beeing chased by spooky ghosts in a dark forest. You must help her navigate through the forest and avoid the ghosts to stay alive.


How to Play

The controls are simple - use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to move the girl up and down. As you move, try to avoid the ghosts that are moving from the right to the left. If you touch a ghost, the game is over.

As you progress through the levels, the game gets more challenging. The ghosts move faster, and there are more of them to avoid. But don't worry - you can do it!
